# email-spam-detection
This project is a machine learning-based email spam detection system built using Python. It uses two well-known datasets — Ling-Spam and Spambase — to train and test multiple machine learning algorithms for accurately classifying emails as spam or ham.

Features:

Preprocessing of text emails using TF-IDF Vectorizer
Combines two benchmark datasets for better generalization
Trained with Logistic Regression (baseline, fast & interpretable)
CLI-based user input system to test with your own email text
Shows prediction + probabilities for Spam vs Ham
Ready to extend into web app / API deployment
